GA Head adds Google Analytics to your site's head, as recommended by Google. Configured via customizer.

== Description ==

GA Head adds Google Analytics code to your site's html head, as recommended by Google.

You can optionally prevent users with a certain capability from being tracked--this can be useful if you don't
want administrators use of the site to affect your analytics, for example.

Options are set from within the Customizer. Look for the "Google Analytics by GA Head" section. You must at least
enter the tracking code for your website (as provided to you by Google) for the plugin to work!

If you are a developer, please see the readme at the plugin's [Github repository](https://github.com/rogerlos/ga_head)
for additional documentation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `ga-head` to your `plugins` directory, or select `ga-head.zip` by using the "Add New" button
on the WordPress admin "Plugins" page.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the tracking code you acquired from Google by opening the Customizer and finding the "Google Analytics" section
